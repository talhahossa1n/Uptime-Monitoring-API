# Uptime Monitoring API
 A raw Node.js-based API for monitoring web uptime. Users can register, authenticate with tokens, and create checks to monitor URLs. The system performs periodic checks to determine if a URL is up or down and notifies users of status changes. Includes user, token, and check management with full CRUD support, built using custom libraries and modules.
